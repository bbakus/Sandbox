THE COSMIC ORACLE

This project has been quite the adventure. It started out as an experiment, early on. I randomly decided to catalog my entire
deck of Prism Oracle cards, which had suits of 5 cards based on colors. So I made 9 different objects, one for each suit.
Next I thought I'd put the objects together in an array to form a full 'deck'. Eventually I thought it would be really
cool if I could somehow create a function that randomly 'draws' a card. After a lot of research, and some great assitance, I finally got a drawCard() function running, and I could console log the result of the draw, it was a sublime moment.

This fully fueled start gave me quite the momentum, and I thought it would be great to create a new function, the threeCardSpread().
It ended up being a seamless process, calling the drawCard() three times, and since we we're into the DOM section of the program
it felt rather perfect to tie the calls together inside nested evenListener methods, triggering the spread in squence.
Soon after, I had to rebuild the database because I suddenly decided "**** the Prism Oracle, I want to make my own deck."

I'm honestly thrilled to be in the age of AI, because my new friend Claude and I spent 8 hours creating a whole deck from scratch. 
New cards, new interpretations, new suits, and most importantly: the images. Something like that would have taken me an incredibly long time to put together from scratch. So I ended up rebuilding the entire 241 line db.JSON file, and it was absolutely worth it.

All that was left to do was piece together the parts under the hood, throw a coat of paint on, and buff. I truly wish I had bought a manual for css; why am I so bad with it? Against all odds I crawled through the debris that was my overlapping div's,
my confusingly centered text and also more tangled div's. There are so many things I want to do to truly finish this, but 
the bell tower is sounding and this project is awaited.

This is a place for me to play around with code, and practice. I want to make a lot of fun things to get even more comfortable with Javascript.

This has already turned into quite the project. I have recreated my Prism Oracle Deck(with some tasteful adjustments)
and it has two functions: a single card pull, and a three card pull, which features an additional meaning if more than 1 card of the
same color suit appears in the spread. I'm going to try and turn this into a website. Wish me luck.
